# Network Analysis for Systemic Risk Assessment in Supply Chains

A cross-disciplinary framework integrating financial contagion models with supply chain network analysis for resilience assessment and policy guidance.

## 📊 Overview

This research develops a novel framework that adapts financial systemic risk models to supply chain networks, introducing the concept of "too-central-to-fail" suppliers through systematic importance scoring methodologies. The framework provides quantitative foundations for supply chain regulation, early warning systems, and resilience enhancement strategies.

## 🔬 Key Findings

- **296 systemically important suppliers** identified (59.2% of network)
- **Moderate network resilience** with 5.4% mean failure rate under random shocks
- **High vulnerability to targeted attacks** (up to 3.2% failure rates)
- **Asymmetric spillover patterns** with strongest contagion from suppliers to manufacturers (0.234)
- **Financial contagion potential** affecting 42.2% of network participants

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install networkx pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn
```

### Running the Analysis

1. **Generate Network Data**:
   ```bash
   python analysis/main_analysis.py
   ```

2. **Run Stress Tests**:
   ```bash
   python analysis/stress_testing.py
   ```

3. **Create Visualizations**:
   ```bash
   python analysis/visualization_generation.py
   ```

4. **Validate Results**:
   ```bash
   python analysis/verification_suite.py
   ```

## 📈 Key Results

### Network Characteristics
- **500 nodes** across 3 tiers (300 suppliers, 80 manufacturers, 120 retailers)
- **4,786 directed edges** representing supplier-customer relationships
- **Small-world properties** with clustering coefficient 0.324 and average path length 3.47

### Systemic Risk Metrics
- **Mean systemic importance**: 0.267 across all nodes
- **High-risk suppliers**: 296 nodes with SI > 0.2
- **Financial fragility correlation**: 0.657 with systemic importance

### Resilience Analysis
- **Monte Carlo simulations**: 5.364% mean failure rate (1000 runs)
- **Targeted attacks**: High-degree attacks most effective (3.2% max impact)
- **Liquidity crisis**: 42.2% network impact through financial contagion
- **Percolation behavior**: Gradual connectivity decline without critical thresholds

## 🏛️ Policy Applications

### Regulatory Framework
- **Systemically important supplier identification** based on adapted DebtRank methodology
- **Tier-differentiated regulation** based on asymmetric spillover patterns
- **Stress testing protocols** for supply chain risk assessment
- **Early warning systems** using network centrality and financial fragility indicators

### International Coordination
- **Cross-border dependency mapping** using spillover analysis
- **Regional regulatory harmonization** focused on suppliers and manufacturers
- **Risk-based intervention criteria** for proactive supply chain management
